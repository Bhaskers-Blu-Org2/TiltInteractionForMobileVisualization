## Setup / Testing

1. Open a terminal and navigate to this directory

2. Ensure that [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) is installed

3. Install the necessary packages with the `npm install` command

4. Start the node server with: `npm start`

5. Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in Chrome. For emulating a mobile usage environment, launch the Chrome debugger (`CTRL + SHIFT + J`) and toggle the device emulator (`CTRL + SHIFT + M`); select your desired mobile device. Note that the application will only be visible in portrait mode in the mobile emulator.
